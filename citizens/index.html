<h3>AMDEP | Citizens, CSOs and Media</h3><br>
<p>I had been hungry all the years-<br>
My noon had come, to dine-<br>
I, trembling, drew the table near<br>
And touched the curious wine.<br>
</p><p>
'T was this on tables I had seen<br>
When turning, hungry, lone,<br>
I looked in windows, for the wealth<br>
I could not hope to own.<br>
</p><p>
I did not know the ample bread,<br>
'T was so unlike the crumb<br>
The birds and I had often shared<br>
In Nature's dining-room.<br>
</p><p>
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new,--<br>
Myself felt ill and odd,<br>
As berry of a mountain bush<br>
Transplanted to the road.<br>
</p><p>
Nor was I hungry; so I found<br>
That hunger was a way<br>
Of persons outside windows,<br>
The entering takes away.</p>
