    <h3>Citizen and Social Media</h3>
    <p>The cost of internet services means that few Afghans have access at home or work, and internet cafes are mostly restricted to larger towns and limited data rates. However many now have mobile phones and the impending introduction of 3G services is expected to increase mobile web access. Cellphone networks now extend to 60% of the population and there are around 13 million subscribers (World Bank 2011). Where access is available, there is demand, with Facebook usage up some 300% in 12 months (Socialbakers). See our companion Afghanistan Media Usage (link) map for details of internet and cellphone access.</p>
    <p>Internews is established Multimedia Centers in key locations to provide citizens and civil society organisations with access, training and platforms to use new media tools. Internews works with local CSOs to host these centers and to helps train staff so that these are much more than internet cafes. The centers are used for other media projects including the Afghan Youth Voices Festival and support for provincial womenâ€™s human rights organisations. The map shows some location and data associated with AMDEP activity. As part of the AMDEP monitoring and evaluation program the following new baselines have been established by Internews:</p>
