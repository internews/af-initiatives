    <h3>Local Media Development</h3>
    <p>Internews helps to establish local media infrastructure, to train media sector workers in a wide range of journalism, production, management and business skills, and to provide ongoing national programming, technical, policy and regulatory support. Internews' Afghanistan staff perform some of this work, but much is undertaken by Internews' local partners. </p>
    <p>This map shows the location of Internews established media local radio stations (note: tv stations forthcoming in 2012) and training centers operated by Internews partner Nai. Hover on any location to learn more about that station or training center. To learn more about Nai visit <a href="http://www.nai.org.af" target="_new">www.nai.org.af</a>.</p>
    <p>AMDEP includes a large monitoring and evaluation program, including research into local media impact in twelve focus locations. This includes new baseline studies, yielding the following results (1433 respondents). As AMDEP progresses additional data will be collected and impact assessments available on this site.</p>
